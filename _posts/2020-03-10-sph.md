title: SPH
---

Welcome! I'm Owen, and this is the development blog for my 2020[^1] Lagrangian[^2] fluid simulation project.
Here I'll document progress updates, design decisions, and distillations of fluid simulation principles.
Hopefully it'll be a good time. :)

[^1]: I make this distinction because I somehow end up working on a fluid simulation project every year (ever since May 2016). Actually, this year I have two so far.

[^2]: A snob's way of saying "particle-based fluid simulation."

As of today, I've implemented a barebones SPH fluid simulation on the basis of
[Steve Rotenberg's lecture slides](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/sp19/cse291-d/#sessions),
the [2014 SPH STAR report](https://cg.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/2014_EG_SPH_STAR.pdf), this [2003 paper by Müller et al.](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/sca03.pdf), and this [report by Kelager](http://image.diku.dk/projects/media/kelager.06.pdf).
SPH, short for "smoothed particle hydrodynamics," basically means that we compute fluid quantities as functions of nearby particles, where the functions vary smoothly with respect to distance. Note that in our Lagrangian frame of reference, each particle represents a small sample of the fluid, and has a particular radius of influence called a _support radius_.

```
class Particle {
    float mass, density, pressure;
    vec3 position, velocity, acceleration;
};
```

## Preliminaries

In general, a physical simulation can be abstracted into the following loop:
```
while (not done)
  update:
    compute forces
    integrate motion
  draw:
    render current state
```

SPH is no exception. I follow Algorithm 1 from the [STAR report](https://cg.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/2014_EG_SPH_STAR.pdf), which describes what to do for a single update step. I also render the particles as spheres using OpenGL.

### Navier-Stokes

According to the Navier-Stokes equations, the acceleration of a particle is given by

\\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{a} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \nu\nabla^2\mathbf{v} + \frac{\mathbf{f}\_\text{other}}{m}
\end{aligned}\\]

Broadly, \\(-\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p\\) is the acceleration due to pressure (\\(\rho\\) is density, \\(p\\) is pressure), \\(\nu\nabla^2\mathbf{v}\\) is the acceleration due to viscosity (\\(\nu\\) is the viscosity coefficient, \\(\mathbf{v}\\) is velocity), and \\(\frac{\mathbf{f}\_\text{other}}{m}\\) is the acceleration due to other forces such as gravity (\\(m\\) is mass).

Thus, by Newton's first law, the net force acting on a particle is

\\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{f} &= m\mathbf{a} \\\
&= -\frac{m}{\rho}\nabla p + m\nu\nabla^2\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}\_\text{other}
\end{aligned}\\]

### Kernel Functions

To quote Steve Rotenberg's slides, "a kernel function \\(W\\) represents the strength of a particle's influence as a function of the distance from the particle."

As per Müller et al., I use different kernels for density, pressure, and viscosity.

#### Density Kernel (Poly6)

\\[\begin{aligned}
W\_d(\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j, h) &=
\begin{cases}
  \frac{315}{64 \pi h^9} (h^2 - \\|\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j\\|^2)^3 & \text{if } \\|\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j\\| \leq h \\\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}\\]

for \\(h\\) the support radius.

#### Pressure Kernel Gradient

I use Debrun's spiky kernel to compute pressure forces. Here, a spiky kernel is advantageous because its gradient does not vanish near the center (unlike a kernel with a flat, rounded top), causing higher repulsive forces between particles which are very close together.

\\[\begin{aligned}
\nabla W\_s(\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j, h) &=
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial W(\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j, h)}{\partial x\_{i, x}} \\\
\frac{\partial W(\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j, h)}{\partial x\_{i, y}} \\\
\frac{\partial W(\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j, h)}{\partial x\_{i, z}}
\end{bmatrix} \\\
&= \kappa(\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j)
\end{aligned}\\]

for

\\[\begin{aligned}
\kappa &=
\begin{cases}
  -\frac{45 (h - \\|\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j\\|)^2}{\pi h^6 \\|\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j\\|} & \text{if } \\|\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j\\| \leq h \\\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}\\]

#### Viscosity Kernel Laplacian

\\[\begin{aligned}
\nabla^2 W\_v(\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j, h) &=
\begin{cases}
  \frac{45 (h - \\|\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j\\|)}{\pi h^6} & \text{if } \\|\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j\\| \leq h \\\
  0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{aligned}\\]

## Computing Forces

```
compute forces:
  compute neighbors
  compute pressure
  accumulate forces from pressure, viscosity, and gravity
```

### Neighborhood search

For each of the following computations, we will need to know the neighbors of each particle (i.e. particles within the support radius). At the beginning of each time step, I build a uniform grid hash table [dividing space into (support) x (support) x (support) cells] and use it to identify the neighbors of each particle in \\(O(n)\\) time. I then save those neighbors as a list attached to each particle and use them to compute forces.

#### Hash function

\\[\begin{aligned}
w\_\text{grid} &= (x\_\text{max} - x\_\text{min}) / h \\\
h\_\text{grid} &= (y\_\text{max} - y\_\text{min}) / h \\\
f(x, y, z) &= w\_\text{grid}h\_\text{grid}\frac{z - z\_\text{min}}{h} + w\_\text{grid}\frac{y - y\_\text{min}}{h} + \frac{x - x\_\text{min}}{h}
\end{aligned}\\]

where \\(x\_\text{min}\\), \\(y\_\text{min}\\), \\(x\_\text{max}\\), and \\(y\_\text{max}\\) are the parameters of the axis-aligned boundary box. Technically there are also some `ceil`s, `floor`s, `min`s, `max`es, and `fmodf`s in there (to make sure everything gets put in the right cell), but this should give you the gist.

### Pressure computation

For particle \\(i\\):

\\[\begin{aligned}
\rho\_i &= \sum\_j m\_j W\_d(\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j, h) \\\
p\_i &= k \left( \rho\_i - \rho\_0 \right)
\end{aligned}\\]

where the sum is over the neighborhood of particles (which should include particle \\(i\\) itself). \\(k\\) is the stiffness constant and \\(\rho\_0\\) is the rest density.

### Force due to pressure

This force will push particles from high-pressure regions to low-pressure regions. Note that the sum over neighbors should not include the particle itself; this is a force exerted on each particle by other surrounding particles.

For particle \\(i\\):

\\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{f}\_\text{pressure} &= -\frac{m\_i}{\rho\_i} \nabla p\_i \\\
&= -\frac{m\_i}{\rho\_i} \left[ \rho\_i \sum\_{j \neq i} m\_j \left( \frac{p\_i}{\rho\_i^2} + \frac{p\_j}{\rho\_j^2} \right) \nabla W\_s(\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j, h) \right] \\\
&= -m\_i \sum\_{j \neq i} m\_j \left( \frac{p\_i}{\rho\_i^2} + \frac{p\_j}{\rho\_j^2} \right) \nabla W\_s(\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j, h)
\end{aligned}\\]

### Force due to viscosity

Viscosity smooths out the velocity field, "dampening" the fluid.

For particle \\(i\\):

\\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{f}\_\text{viscosity} &= m\_i \nu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v}\_i \\\
&= \frac{m\_i \nu}{\rho\_i} \left( \sum\_j \frac{m\_j}{\rho\_j}(\mathbf{v}\_j - \mathbf{v}\_i) \nabla^2 W\_v(\mathbf{x}\_i - \mathbf{x}\_j, h) \right)
\end{aligned}\\]

### Force due to gravity

\\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{f}\_\text{gravity} &= m\mathbf{g}
\end{aligned}\\]

where \\(g = \begin{bmatrix}0 & -9.8 & 0\end{bmatrix}^\top\\) assuming an upward \\(y\\)-axis.

### Net Force

\\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{f}\_n &= \mathbf{f}\_\text{pressure} + \mathbf{f}\_\text{viscosity} + \mathbf{f}\_\text{gravity}
\end{aligned}\\]

## Integrating Motion

```
integrate motion:
  do integration
  do collision handling
```

I use simple forward Euler integration for now.

\\[\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{a}\_n &= \mathbf{f}\_n / m \\\
\mathbf{v}\_{n + 1} &= \mathbf{v}\_n + \mathbf{a}\_n \Delta t \\\
\mathbf{x}\_{n + 1} &= \mathbf{x}\_n + \mathbf{v}\_{n + 1} \Delta t
\end{aligned}\\]

### CFL Condition

Optionally, I constrain the time step to be at most \\(\frac{0.4h}{\\|\mathbf{v}\_\text{max}\\|}\\), so that no particle moves more than four-tenths of the support radius in one physics update.

### Collision Handling

If a particle is outside of the boundary box after integration, I move it back to the collision point on the boundary, and add a scaling (proportional to how far the particle had traveled past the boundary) of the boundary's normal to the particle's velocity.

## Rendering Current State

```
render current state:
  display with OpenGL
  export frames to files
```

Currently, I render the particles as spheres using OpenGL. To create a triangle representation of a sphere, I follow the first method from [this page](http://www.songho.ca/opengl/gl_sphere.html) with sector and stack counts of 36 and 18 respectively. Also, since every particle shares the same geometry, I use instancing (`glDrawElementsInstanced` with [instanced arrays](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Instancing)[^3]) to improve performance.

[^3]: More specifically, I create an instanced array (basically a buffer which can be accessed on a per-instance basis) of particle positions, and then use those particle positions to determine the world-space position of each vertex in the vertex shader.

## Current Results

I set the parameters as follows ([reference](http://image.diku.dk/projects/media/kelager.06.pdf)):

```

## What's Next?

I might not get around to updating this blog for a while, because this was all I needed to do for my class project and now I have paper deadlines to worry about. But at some point I'd like to experiment with surface extraction and high-quality rendering, GPU acceleration, guiding, and more interesting scene geometries with more sophisticated collision handling.
